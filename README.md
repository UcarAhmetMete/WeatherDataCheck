Temperature Analysis and Heatwave Detection:

This project analyzes daily temperature data across 5 cities for a period of 30 days to detect heatwave occurrences. A heatwave day is defined as a day when the temperature exceeds the city's mean temperature for the month by at least 2 standard deviations.

Project Overview
Objective: To analyze temperature data, calculate the mean and standard deviation for each city, and detect heatwave days.
Data: The project uses temperature data stored in a CSV file, which contains daily temperature readings (in degrees Celsius) for 5 cities over a month (30 days).
Technology: Python, NumPy
